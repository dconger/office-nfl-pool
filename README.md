# office-nfl-pool
A fun introduction to Pandas andScikit-Learn using NFL data.
I will try to update player data periodically.

The code works without additional installation if you are
using [Anaconda][anaconda].

## Main use
The code is intended for Python 3 but I have added
future statements to (hopefully) work in Python 2.7.
It works for Anaconda's 2.7 distribution.

```
python3  make_predictions.py
```

## The notebooks
Also, do try out [the notebook][nb1]! You can execute either the
`Office Football Pool (2015).ipynb` or `Fantasy (first steps).ipynb`
